# FizzBuzz

This is a simple task often asked in programming interviews. Typically it is described as follows:

For each number 1 to 100, do the following:

1. If the number is divisible by three, print "Fizz".
2. If the number is divisible by five, print "Buzz".
3. If the number is divisible by both three *and* five, print "FizzBuzz".
4. If none of the previous conditions are true, simply print the number.
